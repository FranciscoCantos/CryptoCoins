<h1 align="center" id="title">Crypto Coins</h1>

Crypto coins app is made to learn and test concepts of SwiftUI, Async/Await, SwiftData, testing and much more using a MVVM architecture.

In this app you can select between 2 tabs. One contains the main crypto currencies with their value information and by clicking on each of them you can access to detail information and a graph of their historical values.
In the next tab you can see a list of all available currencies that takes time to download due to the volume of information. Also in this list you can search for crypto currencies. This information is persisted using SwiftData.
